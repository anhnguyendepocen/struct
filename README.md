# UTexas Structural Econometrics
## HW 2

### BLP TODO

#### Estimation
* Improve estimation by using exogenous variables instead of just instruments
* Standard Errors

#### Counterfactuals
* Exploit the same simulations to make computation quicker (avoid loops/memory errors)
* calcualte derivatives quickly
* Figure out how I am going to do fsolve (if I can do the derivative quickly)
* Figure out how I am going to do surplus
